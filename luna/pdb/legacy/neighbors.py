    """Get all neighbors from a residue.

    In the case of an amino acid that is part of a peptide bond, its neighbors
    are any predecessor or successor residues.
    The same idea applies to nucleic acids.

    Parameters
    ----------
    residue : :class:`~luna.MyBio.PDB.Residue.Residue`
        The residue or other molecule from which covalently bound molecules
        will be recovered.
    select : :class:`~luna.MyBio.PDB.PDBIO.Select`
        Decides which atoms will be consired. By default,
        all atoms are accepted.

    Returns
    -------
    neighbors : dict of {str : :class:`~luna.MyBio.PDB.Residue.Residue`}
        A dictionary containing the predecessor (``previous``) or
        successor (``next``) molecules.
