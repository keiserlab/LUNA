    ``AtomGroupNeighborhood`` makes use of a KD Tree implemented in C,

    Parameters
    ----------
    atm_grps : iterable of `AtomGroup`, optional
        A sequence of `AtomGroup` objects, which is used in the queries.
        It can contain atom groups from different molecules.
    bucket_size : int
        Bucket size of KD tree.
        You can play around with this to optimize speed if you feel like it.
        The default value is 10.
